# Draw On Screen (Hand moment detection) using OpenCV

Using this code you will be able to draw patterns on your screen. The code detects yellow color moment. 
You can use any yellow color tip to move the pointer on the screen as shown in demo. Here I use opencv library along with numpy.

### Requirements:
opencv-python <br>
numpy
python 2.7
